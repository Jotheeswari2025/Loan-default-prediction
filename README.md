# Loan-default-prediction
I have analysed loan default prediction dataset from kaggle and did data cleaning, data transformation, added new columns and created some insights on who are falling on defaulters list, what are the factors contributing to loan defaults and how we can minimize loan defaults by not giving loan to people with certain criteria.

#Data visualization
I have created data visualization in Power BI

#SQL-PostgreSQL
Checked all metrics are correct using PostgreSQL
